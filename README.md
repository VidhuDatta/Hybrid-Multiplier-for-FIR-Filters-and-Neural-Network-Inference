* Wallace Tree Multiplier:
Wallace Tree Multiplier (WTA) is a parallel multiplier that works on the Wallace Tree algorithm to efficiently multiply two integers. In this multiplier,

* Any three wires with the same weights and input into a full adder. The result will be an output wire of the same weight and an output wire with a higher weight for each three input wires. 
* If there are two wires of the same weight left, input them into a half adder. 
* If there is just one wire left, connect it to the next layer.

Advantage: High-speed operation with medium complexity

Disadvantage: Large chip area
